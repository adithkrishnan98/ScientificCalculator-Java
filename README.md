# Scientific Calculator
Built a scientific calculator using Java programming language by implementing an object-oriented design. The calculator is built as a command line application and takes inputs from user for any operation they select based on the operation list displayed to them. All inputs, calculations and results are saved in a file named CalculationsHistory.txt.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
